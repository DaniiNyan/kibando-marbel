# Kibando Marbel Heroes
This application is a wiki of our comics (It has nothing to do with Angular Heroes List we swear).

## A Brief History
Our team at Marbel Comics developed the current application, however we started to create some tests and we are strugling with it. Because of that we are hiring you guys. We need to create some new and urgent stuff and we believe we have a few bugs so we need to test the stories we have been doing. Buuuut, we need to ask a favor. We have created some tests using cypress and one of then is failing. Can you help us to fix it before we start? It's going to be free of charge of course (a professional courtesy);

## User Stories
Here are listed a few things that we used to create our features (We learned how to write then with our Project Manager)

### Hero Listing
We as core team need to see the heroes so we show them to our users.

### Hero Creation
As Users we need to be able to create new users.

### Hero Editing
As the head of the company I want the heroes to be able to change names.

### Hero search
As Marketing head I need to be able to filter heroes by it's name.

### Heroes deletion
As users we need to be able to delete heroes

### Heroes top list
As Marketing head I need to see the top heroes on my dashboard

Ok Guys, this is it. We need to cover the main flows of this User Stories cause I'll be firing the testers soon ok? Take a look at the code too, there is some things that may not be smelling good there. 


Thank you!
